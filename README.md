# A-fishy-situation_game-project

Hey!

This is my first attempt at creating a simple game using pygame.
Many thanks to @Silentt1 who helped me in this adventure.

What is it?
- 
This is David vs goliath, but the wet version of the story... 

In this game is a struggle for survival. You will have to find your way arround a threatenning monster fish who apparently has no clear directional intentions. 
Food is scarse, but falls magically from above regularly. Occasionally, Poseidon himself may send you a banana, or any other form of divine goodies, don't hesitate to catch them for they will bring great riches to you and your family.

Will you be able to survive long enough till the day you take your revenge?
